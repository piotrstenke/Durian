# DUR0001 - Error
### Projects with any Durian analyzer must reference the Durian.Core package.

## Remarks:

Every project that uses a Durian module (e.g. DefaultParam) must reference the Durian.Core package, as it contains, among others, types that are used by the generators to communicate with each other.
