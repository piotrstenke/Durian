# DUR0004 - Error
### Durian modules can be used only in C#.

## Remarks:

This error occurs when the user tries to compile a non-C# project (possibly VB or F#) while referencing a package that is part of a Durian module. Durian was created with only C# in mind, and there are no further plans to expand this project into other CLS languages.

This error will never occur in C# compilation.
