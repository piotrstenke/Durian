# DUR0005 - Error
### Do not add custom types to the Durian.Generator namespace.

## Remarks:

Types in the Durian.Generator namespace are used internally by the source generators to communicate with eachother. Though adding new types to the namespace would seems to be harmless, there is a possibility that this communication would be accidentally disrupted, for example by overriding an essential, already existing type.

The user doesn't have to necessarily add a type to the namespace - even beging the namespace declaration will cause this error.


## Example

### Code with diagnostic:
```csharp
// DUR0005
namespace Durian.Generator
{
	public class Test
	{
	}
}

```
