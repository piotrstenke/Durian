# DUR0002 - Error
### Type cannot be accessed, because its module is not imported.

## Remarks:

Every Durian-related type that is meant to be used directly by the user is contained within the Durian.Core package. Thanks to that even if a module (e.g. DefaultParam) is not imported, all its essential types (like [Durian.DefautParamAttribute](https://github.com/piotrstenke/Durian/blob/master/src/Durian.Core/_attr/DefaultParamAttribute.cs)) are already present in the user's compilation. 

This diagnostic exists to let the user know that the type he's trying to access is part of a specific Durian module,  and unless all packages need by this module are present in the compilation, no actual code generation will take place.
