# DUR0008 - Warning
### Separate analyzer packages detected, reference the main Durian package instead for better performance.

## Remarks:

This diagnostic is reported when a project references more than once Durian analyzer package, but not the main [Durian](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Durian/) package.

Every Durian analyzer package references [Durian.Core](../../src/Durian.Core/README.md) and [Durian.AnalysisServices](../../src/Durian.AnalysisServices/README.md). Since each analyzer package is its own being and has no knowledge of other analyzers, both [Durian.Core](../../src/Durian.Core/README.md) and [Durian.AnalysisServices](../../src/Durian.AnalysisServices/README.md) have to be loaded into memory once per each of those packages. For example, if a project references [Durian.DefaultParam](../../src/Durian.DefaultParam/README.md) and [Durian.InterfaceTargets](../../src/Durian.InterfaceTargets/README.md), [Durian.Core](../../src/Durian.Core/README.md) and [Durian.AnalysisServices](../../src/Durian.AnalysisServices/README.md) will be loaded twice - once for [Durian.DefaultParam](../../src/Durian.DefaultParam/README.md), once for [Durian.InterfaceTargets](../../src/Durian.InterfaceTargets/README.md). In such circumstances, in order to eliminate memory waste, it is recommended to use the main [Durian](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Durian/) package.
