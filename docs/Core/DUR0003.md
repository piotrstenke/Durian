# DUR0003 - Error
### Do not use types from the Durian.Generator namespace.

## Remarks:

Types in the Durian.Generator namespace are used internally by the source generators to communicate with each other.  Letting an outsider use any of this types could cause many unintended consequences.


## Example

### Code with diagnostic:
```csharp
using Durian.Generator;
using Durian.Info;

// DUR0003
[assembly: EnableModule(DurianModule.DefaultParam)]

```
