**This is the main package of the Durian framework. Here you can access all the existing Durian modules.**

## What does this package include?

This package includes almost every existing Durian package, that is:
 - [Durian.Core](../Durian.Core/README.md)
 - [Durian.Core.Analyzer](../Durian.Core.Analyzer/README.md)
 - [Durian.DefaultParam](../Durian.DefaultParam/README.md)
 - [Durian.GenericSpecialization](../Durian.GenericSpecialization/README.md)

The following packages are not included and still have to be referenced manually:
 - [Durian.AnalysisServices](../Durian.AnalysisServices/README.md)
 - [Durian.TestServices](../Durian.TestServices/README.md)

## Remarks

In order to ensure best user experience, some of the dependent packages contain minor changes compared to their official versions, and thus should not be referenced directly from NuGet when this package is present in the compilation. This includes: 

 - [Durian.Core.Analyzer](../Durian.Core.Analyzer/README.md)
 - [Durian.DefaultParam](../Durian.DefaultParam/README.md)
 - [Durian.GenericSpecialization](../Durian.GenericSpecialization/README.md)
 - [Durian.FriendClass](../Durian.FriendClass/README.md)
